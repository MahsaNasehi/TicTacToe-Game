## Game Rules
# Setup:

A 3x3 grid is drawn or displayed.
One player is assigned the symbol X and the other O.
# Gameplay:

Players take turns placing their symbols in empty spaces within the grid.
The game alternates between the players until one of them wins or the grid is filled.
# Winning:

A player wins if they successfully align three of their symbols:
Horizontally: All symbols in the same row.
Vertically: All symbols in the same column.
Diagonally: Symbols aligned from corner to corner.
# Draw:

If all spaces in the grid are filled and no player has achieved a winning alignment, the game ends in a draw (also called a tie).
